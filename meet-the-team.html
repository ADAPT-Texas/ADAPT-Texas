          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined because I knew that the effort we put into the projects goes directly to help a real person. This brings real value to the work our members do, it's not just something fancy you can put in a resume, these efforts are actual advocacy.</p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined because I grew up facing life with a disability and parents who would try to adapt many things for me, ranging from pants to sports equipment. I wanted to provide those same efforts, as an engineering student equipped with a variety of skill sets, to those who can also feel empowered and go about their day to day playing with their toys too!</p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT because it is an organization that really resembled a part of who I am. Growing up, like most kids I always loved toys (and still do), and have so many core memories of building things like Hot Wheel tracks, Lego structures, and more with my Dad and brother. I wanted all kids to be able to experience the joy that comes as a result of the exploration toys allow.</p>

        <p class="team-year">Year: 3rd Year</p>
        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT TX so I could put the engineering skills I had learned to practical use. As entertaining as my classes were, none of them gave me a chance to make a meaningful impact on someone's life, or put my skills to the test in real engineering design scenarios. ADAPT TX’s work has given context to my course work and given me a chance to be a part of something greater. </p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT TX to share the skills and knowledge I’ve gained from my experiences, to inspire students to dream bigger, give students the ability to craft their dreams, and to show how design can create change for others and ourselves.</p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT Texas because it enables me to use the skills and knowledge I have gained in engineering to help make a difference in someone’s life. There are children and people out there that will benefit greatly from the work ADAPT does and I hope to be a part of that.</p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT to improve my skills in engineering, whilst making products that will better the lives of children who aren’t as privileged as others. Seeing how a small attachment I designed becomes a part of a bigger purpose for a child brings me joy that not many other aspects of my life can bring.</p>

        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>Initially, I joined because I knew some of the leaders, but as I became more familiar with the mission and projects, I quickly realized how meaningful this work truly is. The idea of adapting toys so that children with disabilities can experience the same joy, independence, and creativity as any other child deeply resonated with me. What started as a simple connection to friends grew into a personal commitment to use my skills to create real change in my community.</p>

        <p class="team-year">Year: 4th Year</p>
        <div class="team-why">
          <h4>Why did you join ADAPT?</h4>
          <p>I joined ADAPT because I loved the idea of working with families and children. Unlike other engineering organizations that are only concerned with resume building and funding the next big tech innovation, you could see the direct impact ADAPT had on a family's life. Having worked as lead for one of the projects at ADAPT, it is so inspiring to see the next generation of members have that same sense of purpose, a sense of wanting to help and care for others at the core of why they became engineers.</p>
